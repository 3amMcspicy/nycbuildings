# New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) electricity and water consumption visualization

### Description of project goal:
The project is to develop an interactive webapp to visualize electricity and water consumption data in NYCHA housings.

### Reasoining for the project:
In order to move towards a sustainable future, societies should be aware of how much of water and electricity they are consuming. While water management ensures cities have a steady supply of water, an effective way to conserve water is changing the consumer's behaviour. An example of this would be the californian government passing regulations on watering lawns. Similarly, being mindful of electricity consumption translates to less carbon emissions need to produce those energy. In the event that there are outliers, it might be indicative of leakages as well. In addition, this project helps to visualize the changes in consumption over the seasons as well. This may be useful to see where more supply of the water/electricity may need to be diverted to. Finally, the pandemic has led to an exodus of residents away from New York City. Using data from march 2020 onwards, it might be possible to see if it also affected residents in NYCHA housing. 

### Description of code:
Unsure yet. 
streamlit as an interactive webpage.
### Description of data:
Images are taken from Google image api?
### Description of user interaction:
There will be basic information on the website about common bacterias. Users can learn from it first, before clicking on a testing game where an image is queried from Google and users have to select the correct shape/bacteria name to match it.
