# project
An outline for an achievable goal before end of semester
### Description of project goal:
A simple webapp that teaches about bacterial shapes (potentially more). Users can test their knowledge by playing a simple labelling game when prompted with a picture of a bacteria. 
### Description of code:
Unsure yet. 
Kivy as an interactive webpage.
### Description of data:
Images are taken from Google image api?
### Description of user interaction:
There will be basic information on the website about common bacterias. Users can learn from it first, before clicking on a testing game where an image is queried from Google and users have to select the correct shape/bacteria name to match it.
